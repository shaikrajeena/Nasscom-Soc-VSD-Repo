**1.Introduction to open-source  EDA, OpenLANE and SKY130 PDK**

##### 1.1	How to talk to computers
   
* _Introduction to QFN-48 package_:

Every board, every electronic circuitry or FPGA board will have the processors. For example, take the below board (ARDUINO).

The VLSI industry will work on the inside the highlighted chip(IC). The typical overview of the chip is shown in below diagram.

If we want to design a particular board then the above figure is the block diagram of the particular board. The center one (Highlighted) is processor and along with the processor we have all the interfaces along with that JTAG,QSPI-FLASH ,ADC ..etc is shown in the figure.As we are talking about the chip design, we need to see inside the chip what and all it is containing and how it is desgined. Let’s study about the inside chip in below content.All processors sit in package (there are different types of packages available) the below figure is the example of package: QFN-48. The chip will be sat inside the package and connected with wire-bonds as shown in below diagrams.

If we open the chip the main part it contains PADS. Through PADs we can send the signals inside the chip or outside the chip. Other part is “CORE” it consists of basic digital logic for example and gate, mux,.etc. If come inside the PADS it consists of all the “foundry IPs”, Where foundry is consists of machines (Where actually chips get manufactured and it is set of machines) where actual chip design/soc design engineers will continuously communicate until the chip manufacturing will be done.IPs are nothing but Intellectual property. Processor will have several IPs, which are nothing but they need some intelligence to build/work particular block (example: UART, I2C,.etc) .where “Macros” are pure digital blocks.The below figure shows the main parts of the inside chips and the foundry IPs and macros are highlighted.
